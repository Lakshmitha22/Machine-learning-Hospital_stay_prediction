Problem Statement

Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.
Task 2:- Create a machine learning model to predict the length of stay (in days) of a
patient entering the Hospital, given various factors about their stay.

The hospital stay prediction ML project successfully developed a model to accurately forecast patient hospitalization durations, aiding in resource management and patient care planning. The model's high accuracy and reliability underscore its potential for practical application in healthcare settings. Future work should focus on refining the model with larger datasets and exploring its integration into clinical workflows.
